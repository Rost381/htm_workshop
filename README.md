# htm_examples
working on various HTM implementations. currently figuring out hotgym.py's time series prediction + anomaly detection.

the tricky bit is that the community core edition gives me some errors (and has some syntax errors baked in, it seems) so i've been recoding it to what looks like a working state. could be i installed it wrong, of course
